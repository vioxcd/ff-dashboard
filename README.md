# Fluffy Folks Dashboard

## TODOs

- [BUG]: username can change. track via IDs instead
- Implement rules (fetch progress -- for filtering scores)
- Implement cover layout as in project slide
- Various way to sort and filter (sort by: most watched, most favorited, most rewatched count. fetch accordingly)
- Fetch media scores (see what's most loved by fluff as differed with AL -- biggest rating difference)
- Ways to look beyond 85 (under 85, maybe with `include low rating` checkboxes)
- Track score changes overtime and display who contributed to the change
