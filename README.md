# Fluffy Folks Dashboard

## TODOs

- 🏅 90+, 🥈 85+, 🥉 80+ sections (use `expander`). As there's no conditional rendering in tabs, probably stick to 90+ and 85+. Also, fetch medium and smaller img urls (85+ sections will show medium/smaller ones to reduce bandwidth).
- ✨  Fluffy Folks's anime of the year 2022 ✨ tab
- Favorites tab (analysis!)
- Most divisive (highest standard dev) & most differed from AL tab (biggest rating difference between fluff and AL)
- Download all used images in local
- Redirect to page on link click
- Tags / genre / studio analysis (there should be a bridge table)
- Various way to sort and filter (sort by: most watched, most favorited, most rewatched count. fetch accordingly)
- Track score changes overtime and display who contributed to the change
