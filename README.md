# Fluffy Folks Dashboard

## TODOs

- 🏅 90+, 🥈 85+, 🥉 80+ sections
- ✨  Fluffy Folks's anime of the year 2022 ✨ tab
- Various way to sort and filter (sort by: most watched, most favorited, most rewatched count. fetch accordingly)
- Fetch media scores (see what's most loved by fluff as differed with AL -- biggest rating difference)
- Ways to look beyond 85 (under 85, maybe with `include low rating` checkboxes)
- Track score changes overtime and display who contributed to the change
- Most divisive (highest standard dev) tab
