But, I think I **need to rethink this**, as I'm currently adjusting/fixing the data that are quick to fetch rather than adjusting/fixing the slower-to-fetch data.  Possible solution: see the `mapping` view again, and start from there to convert `anichan_score` (quick but buggy) to its correct score (slow but correct) for the *actually slow* users |

## TODOs

- [Refactor] Planning to run this for the whole year — think about how to model historical data (lineage?) and its management
- [Refactor] Create object models (class and abstract class?) for every `table create` and `save` method
- [Refactor] use dbt-like data transformation progression. e.g. do not touch the source data (like doing `ALTER ADD` and `UPDATE` in my case) and try to work with staging and intermediate layers (my appropriate_score is currently used to detect bugs, but it could've been separated in bug discovery case vs. actually transforming the score)
- [Tidy] Source API use `score` (singular), but somehow I use `scores` (plural) as column name
- [Upgrade] use ORM to handle table creation and data insertion
- [Upgrade] use dbt to handle SQLs and view re-creation
- [Upgrade] add logging
- [Upgrade] add Airflow to orchestrate data fetch. (add scenario to account for slower data fetch in a more streamlined fashion, e.g. fetch initially, but only fetch when `score_format` of each user changes -- this means detecting the change in `score_format` before fetching data)
- [Upgrade] Add data tests
- [Upgrade] Add API tests
- [Upgrade] Add data access to google sheets (easier to share for people -- server's admin)
- Refactor apps to its own folder and file structures (separate it with data fetching routine)
- Download all used images in local
- Redirect to page on link click
- Various way to sort and filter (sort by: most watched, most favourited, most rewatched count. fetch accordingly)
- Track score changes overtime and display who contributed to the change
- Similarity profile between members
