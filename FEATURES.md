But, I think I **need to rethink this**, as I'm currently adjusting/fixing the data that are quick to fetch rather than adjusting/fixing the slower-to-fetch data.  Possible solution: see the `mapping` view again, and start from there to convert `anichan_score` (quick but buggy) to its correct score (slow but correct) for the *actually slow* users |

|    Bug    | Came across a "circular view reference" bug in `v_appropriate_score`, `v_buggy_users`, and `v_lists`                      |    ‚úÖ   | Solved by adding columns to associated table, e.g. adding `is_buggy` to `users` instead of creating `v_buggy_users`; doing `UPDATE` on buggy `score` instead of creating `v_lists`.

## TODOs

- [Refactor] Planning to run this for the whole year ‚Äî think about how to model historical data (lineage?) and its management
- [Refactor] Create object models (class and abstract class?) for every `table create` and `save` method
- [Refactor] use dbt-like data transformation progression. e.g. do not touch the source data (like doing `ALTER ADD` and `UPDATE` in my case) and try to work with staging and intermediate layers (my appropriate_score is currently used to detect bugs, but it could've been separated in bug discovery case vs. actually transforming the score)
- [Tidy] Source API use `score` (singular), but somehow I use `scores` (plural) as column name
- [Upgrade] use ORM to handle table creation and data insertion
- [Upgrade] use dbt to handle SQLs and view re-creation
- [Upgrade] add logging
- [Upgrade] add Airflow to orchestrate data fetch. (add scenario to account for slower data fetch in a more streamlined fashion, e.g. fetch initially, but only fetch when `score_format` of each user changes -- this means detecting the change in `score_format` before fetching data)
- Download all used images in local
- ‚ú®  Fluffy Folks's anime of the year 2022 ‚ú® tab
- Tags / genre / studio analysis tab (use the user's `statistics` from the API. high goal)
- Favorites tab (analysis!)
- Most divisive (highest standard dev) & most differed from AL tab (biggest rating difference between fluff and AL)
- üèÖ 90+, ü•à 85+, ü•â 80+ sections (use `expander`)
- Redirect to page on link click
- Various way to sort and filter (sort by: most watched, most favorited, most rewatched count. fetch accordingly)
- Track score changes overtime and display who contributed to the change
- Similarity profile between members
