## TODOs

- [Refactor] Create object models (class and abstract class?) for every `table create` and `save` method
- [Bug] AOTY should take into account when the series is completed (should be within the same year, or something like that)
- [Bug] AOTY should take `ONA` format into account when deciding best movie. Fetch `episodes` count as some `ONA` has more than 1 episodes
- Add `anichan_score` in the dashboard (as this is what's used in the `#ranking` channel)
- Fetch all image types for various layout uses
- Download all used images in local
- Fetch relationType (non sequel), source, and format for FF's AOTY
- ‚ú®  Fluffy Folks's anime of the year 2022 ‚ú® tab
- Fetch tags / genre / studio data (there should be a bridge table)
- Tags / genre / studio analysis tab
- Most divisive (highest standard dev) & most differed from AL tab (biggest rating difference between fluff and AL)
- üèÖ 90+, ü•à 85+, ü•â 80+ sections (use `expander`)
- Favorites tab (analysis!)
- Redirect to page on link click
- Various way to sort and filter (sort by: most watched, most favorited, most rewatched count. fetch accordingly)
- Track score changes overtime and display who contributed to the change
